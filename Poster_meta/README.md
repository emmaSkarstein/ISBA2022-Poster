# POSTER DESIGN
The poster design is completely copied from this [Psycho poster](https://www.goldposter.com/10058/). I have also been very inspired by Mike Morrison's \#betterposter campaign, and would definitely recommend checking out his videos on how to make better academic posters in less time, here is one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBjhxjWDiHw. Of course, Mike Morrison's point is to help researchers spend less time on their posters. But I really like fiddling with the design of my poster, and so I tried to adapt his principles while simultaneously trying to copy the design of the movie poster. I think vintage movie posters or advertisements are actually great models for how we could design academic posters, as they grab your attention with impactful and attractive colors and fonts, while at the same time not being too over-crowded and often very minimalistic. I think this use of fonts, colors and simplistic figures or icons can be a great guide, and copying a movie poster makes it more of an interesting challenge rather than a frustration. 

The poster is made in Power Point, using google fonts when I couldn't find a good font match in the default fonts. The equations are made using eulerfont in Latex and appropriate font and background color, and then screen-shotted into the poster. 

The Power Point I used to make the poster is uploaded in this folder.
