# ABSTRACT
Measurement error and missing values in covariates are inescapable in any discipline that deals with data, and both problems have received considerable attention. Despite this, many applied scientists are still not routinely accounting for varying types of measurement error in their covariates.

Here we describe a joint Bayesian framework that simultaneously accounts for measurement error and missing data, by using the fact that missing data can be interpreted as an extreme case of missing data. 
In addition, we show how to account for Berkson measurement error in the same framework, which provides a convenient setup for modelling Berkson measurement error, classical measurement error, missing data, or any combination of these in the same or different covariates. 

By using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) we show how potentially complex Bayesian hierarchical models can be implemented efficiently. The approach is applicable to a wide variety of regression models, some of which will be exemplified in this paper using both simulated and real data.
